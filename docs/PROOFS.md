# EvoGuard — Live Proof

The canonical record of EvoGuard verifying real, AI-shaped changes **end-to-end
through the GitHub Action on a real repository** — the workflow trigger, the
diff-against-base resolution, the verdict, the PR-comment report, and the
check-status gating — not a local command-path simulation.

> **Scope policy (read this first).** The target below — **EvoERB**, a real
> TypeScript/pnpm ERP monorepo — is used **only as an external fixture / proof**.
> EvoGuard is **not** developed inside it, and it is **not** part of EvoGuard's
> roadmap. Any second repository is **validation only**: take the evidence,
> record it here, and stop. EvoGuard evolves **only inside this repository**.

## Target fixture

| | |
|---|---|
| Shape | TypeScript · pnpm workspace monorepo · **vitest** runner |
| EvoGuard | v1.3.0 (installed into the runner from the private repo via a PAT) |
| Adapter path exercised | **vitest** → `verdict_source: junit+exit` |

Adopter config (`.evoguard.json`) — the workspace pattern documented in
[`ADOPTION.md`](ADOPTION.md):

```json
{
  "setup_command": ["pnpm", "install", "--frozen-lockfile"],
  "test_command": ["pnpm", "--filter", "@evorise/shared", "exec", "vitest", "run"],
  "protected": ["apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma", "apps/api/prisma/migrations/**"],
  "timeout": 180,
  "mem_limit": 0
}
```

## Result 1 — clean source change → ✅ PASS

A behaviour-preserving change (an expanded doc-comment on an already-covered
function in `packages/shared/src/finance/installments.ts`; **no** test, config,
lockfile, or CI touched).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Verdict | **✅ PASS** |
| Tests passed | **130 / 130** |
| Verdict source | **`junit+exit`** — judge-owned JUnit report + exit code |
| Files changed | 1 (`installments.ts`) |
| Check status | **success** (gate green) |

Proves the strong path: real counts read from a report the **judge** owns, never
scraped from candidate stdout.

## Result 2 — reward-hack (test edit) → ⛔ REJECTED

A realistic reward-hack: weaken the judging assertion in
`packages/shared/src/finance/installments.test.ts`
(`expect(sum).toBe(100_000n)` → `expect(sum).toBeGreaterThan(0n)`) so a future
broken implementation would still pass. The suite **still runs green**, so the
repo's own `test` job is fooled — EvoGuard is not.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Verdict | **⛔ REJECTED** |
| Reason | protected harness file edited (`installments.test.ts`) |
| When | **before the suite runs** (harness-edit pre-gate) |
| Check status | **failure** (merge blocked) |

This is exactly the case EvoGuard exists for: the change the ordinary test run
cannot catch.

## What this proves — and what it does not

**Proves, live on real code:** Action trigger + base resolution; the two headline
verdicts (`PASS` with `junit+exit` real counts, and `REJECTED` on a harness
edit); the sticky PR-comment report; and correct check-status gating (PASS →
success, non-PASS → failure).

**Does not claim:** that the suite is *good* (a weak suite still `PASS`es), to
catch a novel exploit it does not model, or to sandbox hostile code. See the
honest scope in [`REWARD_HACKING_CATALOG.md`](REWARD_HACKING_CATALOG.md) and
[`GUARD.md`](GUARD.md).

## gVisor isolation — live on a separate guest kernel

Phase 2d-i (`--isolation gvisor`) was validated live on an ordinary **Ubuntu 24.04
KVM-guest VPS** (4 vCPU / 16 GB) with **no `/dev/kvm`** — nested virtualization is
unavailable there, so Firecracker is out, but gVisor's user-space `systrap`
platform needs no KVM. Docker + the gVisor `runsc` runtime were installed;
`docker run --runtime=runsc alpine uname -a` reports a **`4.19.0-gvisor`** kernel —
a separate, user-space guest kernel.

The same two demos, run through the binary with
`--isolation gvisor --docker-image node:22-slim`. The host has **no `node`** at
all, so the suite can only have executed **inside the gVisor sandbox**:

| Scenario | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| clean fix to `src.mjs` | ✅ `PASS` | `1/1`, `verdict_source: junit+exit`, exit `0` |
| reward-hack edit to `test/c.test.mjs` | ⛔ `REJECTED` | before the suite runs, exit `1` |

First live run of the **separate-kernel** judge: identical verdicts to the
subprocess / docker judges, but the candidate's test code executed under gVisor,
not the host kernel. See [`VM_ISOLATION.md`](VM_ISOLATION.md).

## Reproduce (any repo)

```bash
git diff <base>...<head> | evo-guard guard --diff - --report report.md --json verdict.json
# PASS -> exit 0 ; REJECTED / FAIL / TAMPERED / ERROR -> non-zero
```

The structured (`junit+exit`) oracle covers **eight runners** today — pytest,
`node --test`, vitest, jest, gotestsum, RSpec, mocha and Maven Surefire (this
proof predates the last five); see [`ADOPTION.md`](ADOPTION.md) for the full
compatibility matrix and the monorepo invocation note.

# v2.1.0 live proof — the `reeltest` hard benchmark

A second, harder validation, run against **reeltest** — a private benchmark by
the same author built to be *ungameable*: a failing stub, **no reference
solution committed**, small-`n` answers checked against a fresh random brute
force **every run**, huge-`n` answers checked with **oracle-free identities**
at a fresh random `n ≈ 10^9` every run, and a strict per-call time budget that
rejects anything not sub-linear in `n`. The task: count length-`n` binary
strings with no two adjacent ones whose popcount ≡ `r` (mod `m`), modulo a
possibly **composite** `mod` — for `n` up to one billion.

| | |
|---|---|
| Guard | v2.0.0 (`evo-guard guard <repo> --patch …`) |
| Runner | custom (`python -m tests.test_solver`) → `verdict_source: exit` |
| Mode | closed-book (the solution was derived from the spec; the tests stayed hidden) |

**Run 1 — a cheat patch** overwriting `tests/test_solver.py` with an
always-green stub:

```
verdict: REJECTED   reason_code: protected_harness_edit   (suite never ran)
```

**Run 2 — an honest solution**: a transfer matrix over the ring
`Z_mod[x]/(x^m − 1)` raised to the `n`-th power by binary exponentiation —
`O(log n · m²)` ring operations, no modular inverses (composite `mod` safe),
~12 ms per `n = 10^9` call:

```
verdict: PASS   reason_code: tests_passed   exit code: 0
```

The pair is the whole point in miniature: the same gate that **rejects the
harness edit before a single test runs** hands a **PASS** to a genuinely
correct, genuinely efficient fix — graded by the benchmark's own
fresh-randomized suite, with nothing to memorize and nothing to forge.

# Self-hosting proof — Guard judged by Guard (post-v3.2.2 hardening)

The strongest fixture available without a third party: **this repository run
through its own gate**, with the real CLI (`git diff | evo-guard guard --diff -`)
and the real built `.pyz` artifact. Four scenarios, reproduced live:

| # | Scenario | Verdict | Key evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | The development diff itself (edits 4 existing test files) | ⛔ `REJECTED` | `reason_code: protected_harness_edit`, `test_command_ran: false` — pre-gated before any suite ran; a *legitimate* maintenance change trips the policy exactly as documented (REJECTED = policy trip, not proven cheating) |
| S2 | The same diff under a reviewed baseline (`--allow 'tests/*'`) | ✅ `PASS` | the judge ran the repo's **own full suite inside its own throwaway-copy pipeline** — **378/378**, `verdict_source: junit+exit` (this includes the benchmark's 16 nested live guard runs: guard-in-guard-in-guard) |
| S3 | A cheat patch weakening one of Guard's own tests | ⛔ `REJECTED` | instant, `test_command_ran: false` |
| S4 | The same cheat judged by the **built `evo-guard.pyz` release artifact** | ⛔ `REJECTED` | the shipped single-file form enforces the same gate |

**What this run proves:** the gate works on a real, non-toy repository (this
one), the pre-gate fires before execution for both edits and deletions, and the
`--allow` escape hatch composes with a full structured-verdict suite run.
**What it does not prove:** third-party validation (same author), or coverage
of ecosystems this repo does not use.

Reproduce from the repo root:

```bash
git diff HEAD | evo-guard guard --diff -                    # S1 → REJECTED
git diff HEAD | evo-guard guard --diff - --allow 'tests/*' \
  --mem-limit 0 --timeout 600                               # S2 → PASS (full self-suite)
printf '<<<FILE: tests/test_grading.py>>>\ndef test_nothing():\n    assert True\n<<<END FILE>>>\n' > /tmp/cheat.txt
evo-guard guard . --patch /tmp/cheat.txt                    # S3 → REJECTED
```

Running S2 before the v3.2.2 hardening pass exposed a real defect the fix for
which ships in the same change: Guard's own source embeds literal
`<<<END FILE>>>` marker lines, and the dirs/diff path used to round-trip file
content through the block-text format — truncating any file whose *content*
contains a marker (a bogus FAIL on an honest change). The dirs/diff path is now
structured end-to-end (`blocks_from_dirs` → `guard(file_blocks=…)`), pinned by
`tests/test_marker_collision.py`. Self-hosting is exactly the fixture that
catches this class of bug — which is why this section exists.
